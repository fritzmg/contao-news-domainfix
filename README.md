Contao News Domainfix
=====================

Small Contao extension that fixes internal news target links for pages that are on a different domain or language. See [contao/core](https://github.com/contao/core) issues [#3765](https://github.com/contao/core/issues/3765#issuecomment-102825299), [#6743](https://github.com/contao/core/issues/6743) and [#7922](https://github.com/contao/core/issues/7922). 

Since version 1.1 this extension also allows to set an optional target page in the newslist module, which will overwrite the default target of the news archive, if set.
