Contao News Domainfix
=====================

Small Contao extension that fixes internal news target links for pages that are on a different domain. See [#3765](https://github.com/contao/core/issues/3765#issuecomment-102825299)

Since version 1.1 this extension also allows to set a target page in a newslist module.
